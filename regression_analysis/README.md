# Regression Analysis

In this repo we take a look at the different types of regression and how they can be used to solve various problems. We will take a look at estimation approaches:

 - **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**
 - **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
 - **Bayesian (Univariate & Multivariate)**
 
 and attempt to describe them in greater detail. The regression models we describe are:
  
  1. **Linear Regression**
  2. **Ridge Regression**
  3. **Lasso Regression**
  4. **Bayesian Linear Regression**
  5. **Logistic Regression**
  
This repo was inspired by the section **Part II: Early Computer-Age Methods**, in the book **CASI: Computer Age Statistical Inference**, and make reference to the book.
