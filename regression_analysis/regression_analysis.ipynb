This provides us with the ___minimum-variance mean unbiased___ estimation when the errors have finite variances.\n",

    "> *In other words, OLS is consistent if the independent variables are not dependent on the error term. In the same vein, the errors making up this error term should not be correlated but should have the same finite variance. This will give use the __minimum-variance mean unbiased__ estimation.*\n",

    "If we add the assumption that the errors are normally distributed (i.e., follow a [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)), OLS is the ___maximum likelihood estimator___.

    "Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is arguably the twentieth century's most influential piece of applied mathematics, and continues to be the method of choice in the statistician's toolkit. Generally, MLE provides nearly unbiased estimates of nearly minimum variance in an automatic way but tends to overfit in regression tasks. So, MLE allows us to obtain estimators -- an estimator attempts to approximate the unknown parameters using the measured data -- by minimising the variance associated with this process of approximation.\n",

    "**CASI**, _page 91_, discusses the inadequacies and dangers of MLE with reference to the cost of unbiasedness when there are hundreds or thousands of parameters to estimate at the same time. The [___James-Stein Estimator___](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_stein_estimator) illustrated this point dramatically in 1961 using a few unknown parameters, not hundreds or thousands. Discussing the issues with MLE leads to the story of _shrinkage estimation_ - deliberate introduction of biases to improve overall performance, at a possible danger to individual estimates.\n",

    "\n",
    "Similar to Ridge regression. We use this type of regression when  we have large number of variables that are also highly correlated. The goal is to minimize the parameters when variables are highly correlated, that is, attempting to minimize the ___sum of squared residuals___ in the ___OLS___ with the contraint that the __norm (L1)__ of $||\\beta|| \\leq c$, where $c$ is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\hat{\\beta} = arg$ min $\\{||y - \\bf{X}\\beta||^{2}_2 + \\lambda ||\\beta||_1\\},$\n",

    "[ridge]: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat857/files/lesson05/image_09/index.gif \"Geometric Interpretation of Lasso Regression\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation extracted from [here](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/158/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Lasso regression performs **L1** shrinkage, so that there are \"corners\" in the constraint, which in two dimensions corresponds to a diamond. If the ___sum of squares___ \"hits\" one of these corners, then the coefficient corrending to the axis is shrunk to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As $p$ increases, the multidimensional diamond has an increasing number of corners, and so it is highly unlikely that some coefficients will be set to zero. Hence, lasso regression performs ___shrinkage___ and (effectively) ___subset selection___.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In contrast with ___subset selection___, lasso performs a _soft thresholding_: as the smoothing parameter is varied, the sample path of the estimates move continuously to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for lasso regression stems from the difficulties associated with interpreting the ridge regression solution because it is not sparse (no $\\beta$s are set exactly to zero), by asking the question: \n",

    "#### Inferences for Lasso Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinary lasso does not address the uncertainty of parameter estimation; standard errors for $\\beta$s are not immediately available. To infer from a lasso estimator, there are several approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. the bootstrap for the estimation of standard errors and deriving an approximate closed form estimate, _Tibshirani (1996)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. deriving the sandwich formula in the likelihood setting as an estimator for the covariance of the estimates, _Fan and Li (2001)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, both these approaches approximate covariance matrices given an estimated variance of zero for predictors $\\hat{\\beta}_j = 0$. The Bayesian lasso (_Park and Casella, (2008)_) provides valid standard errors for $\\beta4 and more stable estimates by using the posterior ___median___. The lasso estimate is equivalent to the ___mode___ of the posterior distribution under a normal likelihood and an independent Laplace (double exponential) prior:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\pi(\\beta) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}exp(-\\lambda|\\beta_j)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian lasso estimates (posterior medians) appear to be a compromise between the ordinary lasso and ridge regression. _Park and Cassella (2008)_ showed that the posterior density was unimodal based on a conditional Laplace prior, $\\lambda | \\sigma$, a non-informative marginal prior, $\\pi(\\sigma)^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$, and the availability of a Gibbs algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution.\n",

    "> $\\pi(\\beta | \\sigma^2) = \\prod^p_{j=1} \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}} exp(\\frac{\\lambda | \\beta_j}{2\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}})$\n",

    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia entry for [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) provides a friendly interpretation of Bayesianism as it is applied in statistical inference. To quote:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics. Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data ... Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability, often called \"Bayesian probability\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference uses several methods for updating the probability for a hypothesis, one of them being Bayesian updating. Bayesian updating is more commonly used partially because it is computationally efficient and is considered to be rational. Though, Bayesian updating has not always been the traditional approach. [Dutch books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_book) -- a set of odds or bets in gambling that guarantee a profit, regardless of the outcome of the gamble leaving one player strictly worse off and another player strictly better off -- did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. There are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books which apply Bayes' rule to the case where the evidence itself is assigned a probability. Apparently, the additional hypotheses needed to uniquely require Bayesian updating have been deemed to be substantial, complicated, and unsatisfactory.\n",

    ">- $\\alpha$ - the hyperparameter, or vector of hyperparameters, of the parameter distribution, i.e., $ \\theta \\tilde p(\\theta | \\alpha) $.\n",
    ">- $\\bf{X}$ - sample set of $n$ observations denoted $x_1, ..., x_n$.\n",

    ">- The marginal likelihood (sometimes termed the evidence) is the distribution of the observed data marginalized over the parameter(s), i.e., $p(\\bf{X}|\\alpha) = \\int p(\\bf{X}|\\theta)p(\\theta|\\alpha)d\\theta$.\n",
    ">- The posterior distribution is the distribution of the parameter(s) after taking into account the observed data. This is determined by Bayes' rule, which forms the heart of Bayesian inference: $p(\\theta|\\bf{X, \\alpha}) = \\frac{p(\\theta, \\bf{X}, \\alpha)}{p(\\bf{X}, \\alpha)}=\\frac{p(\\bf{X}|\\theta, \\alpha)p(\\theta, \\alpha)}{p(\\bf{X}|\\alpha)p(\\alpha)}=\\frac{p(\\bf{X}|\\theta, \\alpha)p(\\theta|\\alpha)}{p(\\bf{X}|\\alpha)}\\propto p(\\bf{X}|\\theta, \\alpha)p(\\theta|\\alpha)$\n",

    "Bayesian theory calls for the use of the posterior distribution to carry out predictive inference, that is, to predict the distribution of the new, unobserved data point. Therefore, instead of a fixed point being returned in the prediction, a distribution over possible points is returned. In contrast to frequentist methods, with Bayesian statistics it is always possible to determine the posterior predictive distribution - or at least, to an arbitrary level of precision, when numerical methods are used.\n",
