    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a statistical method for approximating the ___unknown parameters___ in a linear regression model by selecting ___parameters___ of linear function from a set of ___explanatory variables___ by the principle of ___least squares___:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *... minimizing the sum of the squares in the differences between the observed ___dependent variable___ (values of the variable being predicted) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function ...*\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS is consistent if ___regressors___ are exogenous (i.e., independent of the error term) in the linear model, errors are ___homoscedastic___ (have the same finite variance a.k.a., homogeneity of the variance) and are not correlated. This provides us with the ___minimum-variance mean unbiased___ estimation when the errors have finite variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add the assumption that the errors are normally distributed (i.e., follow a [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) distribution), OLS is the ___maximum likelihood estimator___.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our data has $n$ observations $\\{y_i, x_i\\}^n_{i=1}$, where each observation $i$ includes a scalar response $y_i$ and a column vector $x_j$ of values of $p$ predictors (regressors) $x_{ij}$ for $j = 1, ... , p$. In a linear regression model, the response variable, $y_i$, is a linear function of the regressors:\n",
