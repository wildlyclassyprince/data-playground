# Tweets Ratio Prediction

In this repository we conduct preliminary analysis towards building a resuable machine learning pipeline of US politician tweets. The objective is to derive reusable models that can reliably determine the author given some text.

- `tweets_predictor_prelim.ipynb` : preliminary analysis and rudimental model building.

- `tweets_predictor_with_dask.ipynb` : advanced analysis and model building.

- `predictor.py` : rudimentary implementation of the predictive task.
