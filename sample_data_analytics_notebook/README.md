# Sample Analytics Notebook

A demonstration of a basic Python data analysis pipeline from the beginning to the end. This is an example of what a data science workflow would look like in reality.

## The Problem Domain

We create a demo machine learning model from the *Iris* dataset that takes four measurements from the flowers:

> 1. Sepal length
> 2. Sepal width
> 3. Petal length
> 4. Petal width

from the following varieties:

> 1. Iris setosa
> 2. Iris versicolor
> 3. Iris virginica

It is important to clearly define the problem statement before proceeding to analysis. We demonstrate its importance in the notebook.
