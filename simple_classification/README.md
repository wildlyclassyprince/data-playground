# Simple Classification

In this repository, we demonstrate the simplicity involved with classifying data using Python's `sci-kit learn` library.

We train on the *Iris* dataset and classify using the following algorithms:

> 1. Decision Tree - we also generate a visualization
> 2. K-Nearest Neighbor
> 3. Neural Net
> 4. Random Forest
