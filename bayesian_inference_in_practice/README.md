# Bayesian Inference in Practice

An introductory notebook to Bayesian inferential analysis. Some of the code and notes are taken from [here](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Data-Analysis/blob/master/bayesian_lr/Bayesian%20Linear%20Regression%20Project.ipynb). Analysis is done using Boston Housing data to demonstrate understanding of concepts, and computation uses the `PyMC3` package.
