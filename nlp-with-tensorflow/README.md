# Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Tensorflow

Inspired by the Standford University course CS224N, we explore some of the currently common techniques associated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL).

In this repo, we explore deep learning models with Tensorflow to classify Twitter text data.
