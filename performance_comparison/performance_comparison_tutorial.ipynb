    "## [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)\n",
    "NumPy provides support for large multidimensinal arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these elements. The project relies on well-known packages implemented in other languages (like Fotran) to perform efficient computations, bringing the user both the expressiveness of Python and a performance similar to MATLAB or Fotran.\n",

    "## [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org)\n",
    "Tensorflow is an open-source library for numerical computation originally developed by researchers and engineers working at the Google Brain team. The main focus of the library is to provide an easy-to-use API to implement practical machine learning algorithms and deploy them to run on CPUs, GPUs, or a cluster.\n",
